# Gold-Price-Prediciton-Project-

## Introduction:

This project is a machine learning project that aims to predict the price of gold using historical data. The project is demonstrated in Python programming language, and it involves the use of various libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, and Seaborn.

## Summary: 

### First Phase:

The first step of the project is to collect historical data on gold prices from various sources such as Yahoo Finance. The data is then preprocessed by cleaning, transforming, and visualizing it to extract insights.

### Second Phase:

After preprocessing the data, the next step is to train and evaluate different machine learning models using the preprocessed data. The models used in this project include Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines.

### Final Phase:
Finally, the best performing machine learning model is selected, and it is used to predict the future price of gold based on current market trends. The project demonstrates how machine learning can be used to make predictions and informed decisions in the financial market.
